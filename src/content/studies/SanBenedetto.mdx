In this role I became the go-to person when things got complicated. I handled escalated issues from the first-line team, worked directly with users, and kept the company’s systems running smoothly every day. My focus was not only fixing problems quickly but also preventing them and making sure everything was secure and reliable.

What I did:

- Solved advanced technical issues with hardware, software, and networking, often under time pressure.
- Looked after Windows and Linux servers — from user accounts to updates and troubleshooting.
- Helped keep the network safe and stable by managing switches, firewalls, and VPNs.
- Applied updates and security patches so systems stayed protected against vulnerabilities.
- Maintained virtual servers (VMware/Hyper-V), making sure the business could scale and stay online.
- Set up and tested backup systems to avoid downtime in case of failures.
- Monitored performance and spotted issues before they became problems.
- Worked with the security team to strengthen policies and prepare for audits.
- Supported colleagues by sharing knowledge and helping newer technicians grow.

Highlights:

- Kept systems highly available and reliable, which helped the company stay productive.
- Reduced downtime by anticipating issues and improving response processes.
- Built a reputation as someone who could be trusted to handle complex challenges calmly and effectively.
