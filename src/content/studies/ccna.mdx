The CCNA certification helped me solidify my networking knowledge and gave me confidence working with real-world IT infrastructure.

I learned how to design, implement, and troubleshoot small to medium networks, configure Cisco devices, and understand basic network security principles. Practicing on routers, switches, and virtual networks made me comfortable managing IP addressing, VLANs, and LAN/WAN setups.

This certification strengthened my ability to solve practical network problems efficiently and laid a solid foundation for advancing in IT and cybersecurity.
