Although I haven’t formally studied the ASIR program, I’ve learned most of its content through work and personal projects. Daily responsibilities managing Windows and Linux servers, configuring networks, and troubleshooting problems gave me practical experience that goes beyond textbooks. 

I also experimented with virtualization, monitoring tools, and scripting in Bash and Python to automate repetitive tasks. Taking ownership of small IT projects allowed me to develop problem-solving skills, work independently, and gain confidence applying technical knowledge in real-world environments.

This hands-on experience complements my formal education and certifications, showing recruiters that I can adapt, learn quickly, and tackle real IT challenges.
