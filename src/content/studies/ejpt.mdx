I am currently pursuing the eJPT v2 (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester) certification.

This program is focused on practical penetration testing skills, covering areas such as network security, web application security, and vulnerability assessment. Through hands-on exercises, I am learning to identify and exploit security weaknesses in controlled environments while applying ethical hacking methodologies.

Although I haven’t completed the certification yet, the coursework is already helping me strengthen my technical skills, improve my problem-solving abilities, and gain confidence in applying penetration testing techniques in real-world scenarios.
