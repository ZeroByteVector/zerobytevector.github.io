During this program, I learned how to develop applications that work across different platforms, from mobile apps to desktop programs. It wasn’t just about coding — I learned to approach problems methodically, work on real projects, and collaborate with teammates.

I gained hands-on experience in programming (Java, C#), databases (SQL), web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP), and system integration.

These projects taught me not only technical skills but also how to manage time, communicate ideas clearly, and see a software project through from start to finish.
