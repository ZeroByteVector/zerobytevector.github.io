Based at the Ceramics Museum of Valencia, Spain & the Refugee Support Center of Mislata, Valencia, Spain

In this role I worked on-site at two locations managed under a contract between Sermicro and the Spanish Ministry. My main responsibility was to provide daily IT support for staff, ensuring their systems remained functional. When issues exceeded my scope, I coordinated directly with the Ministry’s central IT department.

What I did:

- Delivered first-line technical support for employees at both sites (hardware, software, printers, and network connectivity).
- Troubleshot and resolved everyday problems such as login issues, configuration errors, and software malfunctions.
- Escalated larger or critical incidents to the Ministry’s IT department, acting as the link between users and central support.
- Assisted staff with limited technical knowledge, explaining solutions in simple terms.
- Managed time effectively by alternating workdays between two very different environments with distinct needs.

Highlights:

- Developed strong communication skills by being the first point of contact for IT-related problems.
- Gained hands-on experience with government IT systems and processes.
- Strengthened adaptability, working in both a cultural institution and a social service center.
- Built the foundation for advancing to more technical responsibilities in Level 2 support.
