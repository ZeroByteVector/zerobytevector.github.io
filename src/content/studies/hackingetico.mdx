I completed a 300-hour course focused on cybersecurity with a specialization in ethical hacking.

The program covered the essentials of protecting systems, networks, and applications, while helping me understand how attackers think. During the course, I worked on multiple hands-on labs where I applied real-world techniques such as SQL injections, OWASP vulnerabilities, and penetration testing using tools like Burp Suite, Nessus, Nmap, and Kali Linux. I also used scripting and automation with Python and Bash to simulate attacks and improve defensive strategies.

This experience gave me practical skills in identifying and mitigating security risks, strengthened my problem-solving abilities, and allowed me to apply security concepts in realistic scenarios. It also fueled my passion for ethical hacking, combining my background in systems administration with advanced cybersecurity techniques.
